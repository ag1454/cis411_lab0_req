## 1. Overview
In this section provides a brief overview of the business problem.  By brief, it should include a single image (business process or use case diagram) and a textual explanation (describing actors, tasks, information, or outcomes) and described in *Step 4*.

Business problem: “I would like to order a meal from an on-campus provider and have it delivered to my classroom.”

## 2. Requirements
In this section, organize and list requirements from *Step 5*.  You are welcome to organize this section in anyway that you would like (using headings or tables).  The structure of this section should correspond to your overview section, and it is recommended that that you review the [lessons learned](../lessonsLearned.md) from your colleagues.

- **Business**
	- B.1 The system will prevent users from placing orders after 7 PM. The system will also prevent users from placing orders during peak mealtime hours. (Jennifer)
	- B.2 The system must provide a way to disable the delivery option in the event that staff capacity is low. (Jennifer)
	- B.3 The system must pad the anticipated delivery time by five minutes. (Jennifer)
	- B.4 The system must have a maximum number of accepted deliveries. Once it reaches that number, it prevents users from ordering until at least one order has been delivered. (Jennifer)
- **User**
	- U.1 The user must be able to input their location into the system. (Rebekah)
	- U.2 The user must be able to access the system through FalconLink, similarly to how users are able to order food from Union through FalconLink. (Rebekah)
- **Functional**
	- F.1 The system must display the user’s account balance. (Loki)
	- F.2 The system must allow for order cancellations before placing the order. (Loki)
- **Non-functional**
	- N.1 The system must include pictures of the available food options. (Thor)
	- N.2 The system must use a color scheme that doesn’t hinder the ability to read text or identify pictures and icons. (Thor)
- **System**
	- S.1 The system must be able to be accessed from desktop and mobile. (Randy)
	- S.2 The system must have dedicated hardware. (Randy)
	- S.3 The system must be secure in order to protect user information. (Randy)
	- S.4 The system must be able to handle as many accounts as there are students and employees. (Randy)

## 3. Assumptions
